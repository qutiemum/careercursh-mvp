### üéØ STRATEGIC POSITIONING SUMMARY

**From Generic to Strategic**: Instead of positioning Quenby as "another healthcare consultant with project management experience," we position her as **"the strategic operations leader who has already solved NPHS's exact challenge: scaling AI-driven healthcare technology across distributed teams while maintaining operational excellence."**

### üß† COMPANY INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

**NPHS's Strategic Priorities (Based on Intelligence):**
1. **Theranostics Expansion**: $X million investment in Indianapolis center
2. **Technology Integration**: Getting 6,600+ customers to adopt proprietary systems (Isotrac‚Ñ¢, Accutrac‚Ñ¢, Safetrac‚Ñ¢, Nuctrac‚Ñ¢)
3. **Scale Management**: Maintaining "near-perfect" accuracy while growing from 30+ centers
4. **Educational Leadership**: Driving clinician adoption through CE courses and grants

**Hidden Pain Points We Identified:**
- **Technology Adoption Resistance**: Need for "Take a Look Inside" initiative suggests customer education challenges
- **Cross-Functional Coordination**: Managing distributed operations across 30+ centers requires sophisticated project management
- **AI/Technology Integration**: Moving into precision medicine requires leaders who understand both healthcare operations AND technology implementation

### ‚ö° STRATEGIC CONNECTION POINTS

**1. AI Implementation in Healthcare Operations**
- **NPHS Challenge**: Integrating proprietary technology systems across 6,600+ customers
- **Quenby's Strategic Asset**: Led Guidewell Chat AI from inception through deployment, including training, adoption, and pharmacy team integration
- **Strategic Insight**: "I've already navigated the exact challenge NPHS faces - getting healthcare professionals to adopt new AI-driven systems while maintaining operational excellence. At Florida Blue, I didn't just implement AI; I created the adoption framework that turned skeptical pharmacy teams into AI advocates."

**2. Distributed Healthcare Network Management**
- **NPHS Challenge**: Coordinating operations across 30+ PET manufacturing centers with "near-perfect" accuracy
- **Quenby's Strategic Asset**: Managed $136.2M in healthcare projects across distributed teams with 100% on-time delivery
- **Strategic Insight**: "NPHS's challenge of maintaining precision across distributed centers mirrors my experience managing complex healthcare operations across multiple sites. I understand how to maintain quality standards while scaling - it's about systems, not just processes."

**3. Healthcare Technology Adoption Strategy**
- **NPHS Challenge**: Getting clinicians to adopt integrated tech suite (Nuctrac‚Ñ¢ EHR integration)
- **Quenby's Strategic Asset**: Expert in EHR optimization and provider network management with proven stakeholder engagement
- **Strategic Insight**: "The 'Take a Look Inside' initiative tells me NPHS recognizes that technology adoption is about education, not just features. I've built those educational frameworks - turning complex technical capabilities into clear clinical value propositions."

### üé™ INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

**Opening Strategic Statement:**
*"I've been following NPHS's theranostics expansion, and it's exactly the type of strategic challenge I've been solving in healthcare technology - how do you scale precision operations while driving adoption of integrated systems across thousands of independent practitioners?"*

**Key Strategic Questions to Ask:**
1. "What's been the biggest challenge in getting your 6,600+ customers to fully adopt the integrated Nuctrac‚Ñ¢ system?"
2. "As you expand theranostics capabilities, how are you planning to maintain the 'near-perfect' dosing accuracy across an even larger distributed network?"
3. "What role do you see AI playing in NPHS's future operations, particularly in predictive analytics for dosing and delivery?"

**Proof Points for Strategic Value:**
- "At Florida Blue, I led AI adoption that achieved 25%+ operational efficiency improvements - I understand how to make technology adoption feel like a competitive advantage, not a burden."
- "My experience managing $136.2M in healthcare projects with 100% on-time delivery demonstrates I can handle the precision and scale NPHS requires."
- "I've built the cross-functional coordination systems that NPHS needs to manage complex operations across distributed teams."
